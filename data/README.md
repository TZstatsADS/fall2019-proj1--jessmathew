# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

This folder contains the original "lyrics.RData" file that we were given to perform our analysis. I do not use the "artist.csv" data in my analysis.
